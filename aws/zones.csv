2007-10-22,us-east-1,1,1,Since zones were introduced 2008-03-27 before that there were ”no” zones – so one only.

https://web.archive.org/web/20100309055646/http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/entry.jspa?externalID=1347 shows in an example three zones (dated 2008-10-24).
Although note that http://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2009/03/03/amazon-ec2-running-windows-in-eu-region/ implies that windows was runnable earlier in only one zone. See also https://web.archive.org/web/20090209004252/http://aws.amazon.com/windows. For the purpose I'm looking for this isn't an important difference, so ignoring the early windows-linux difference in zone availability."

2012-01-10,us-east-1,5,0,"This is uncertain. https://web.archive.org/web/20121116105540/https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/globalinfrastructure/ from 2012-11-16 shows five zones and https://web.archive.org/web/20121002193033/http://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/globalinfrastructure/  from 2012-10-02 shows four. However there are mentions of us-east-1e on 2012-01-06 (https://twitter.com/cloudcontroller/status/155188928004104193)  and 2012-01-10 (https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?messageID=309405&#309405). The ylastic launch option might be a mistake (early information on not yet published zone accidentally visible to end customers) but the AWS forum seems to be at least not denied by others. AWS seems to have lagged in updating the infrastructure page at other times too, so it can't be taken as base truth uncritically."

No mention that would not be multi-az (as with Tokyo announcement), so assuming minimal az redundancy. Current (2014-06-20) az count is 2, so started with 2."
